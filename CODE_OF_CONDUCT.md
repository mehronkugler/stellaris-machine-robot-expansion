# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people. Be proactive about it. At a minimum it means being civil even if you are having a bad day or something is frustrating.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences. We learn from each other and we don't wanna live in an echo chamber. If you do, there are many echo chambers out there.
* Respect people's pronoun choices. Real simple. If you can't do that, either grow into a person who can, or go elsewhere.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback. Being wrong is fine, everyone is learning, and nobody loses clout for that. The goal is to create a great mod together.
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience. Meaning, learn quickly what not to do, and strive to do better next time.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community. Taking care of your own needs will not involve lashing out at others or being passively toxic. Get yourself in order, then come back.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

1) The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind. Imagery will get you immediately banned for life. Same for lewd comments. If you want to get banned then just leave, don't harm others in the process.
2) Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks. Not having that.
3) Public or private harassment.
4) Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission. This is considered doxxing and you will be reported to Github and appropriate law enforcement agencies.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting, such as **discussing politics or religion**. There are SO many other places to talk about it.
* Gaslighting, ie, "I didn't yell at you, you are just imagining it"

### Self-care

We each pledge to do the things in our lives that keep us happy and healthy.
We pledge to take care of work things and personal things before working on this mod, so that working on this mod is fun and relaxing.
If we have time that we aren't available to work on the mod, that is fine too. We will communicate to each other.

### If a community member wishes to leave

When it's time for one of us to stop working on this mod, we pledge to say goodbye & hand off responsibilities.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
openly-retro (at) maskme (dot) org.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct,
with a few exceptions:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with

includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an

# This inline script addresses the following scenarios:
# 1 - NOT rogue servitor (see oxr_mdlc_servitor)
# 2 - is / is not catalytic
# 3 - planet is FACTORY designation

# Notes: Base production is 10 alloys for catalytic. this is already scripted
# before getting to this point. So maths here will take that assumption.
# Upkeep is already calculated for catalytics (24 food)

# When in factory designation, produce 2 artisan drone output
# 20 good production, 20 minerals upkeep

# NOthing to add for catalytic empires here bc factory mode means goods

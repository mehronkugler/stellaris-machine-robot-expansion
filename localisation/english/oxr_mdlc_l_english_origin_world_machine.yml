 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_awakened:0 "World-Machine, Awakened"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_awakened_desc:0 "For <<§RERR TIMESPAN NOT FOUND§!>> aeons, automatic processes spanned cities, worlds, and galaxies. The hydro dams churned, the auto-mines whirred, the bio-vats bubbled, creating untold resources. Ships descended to transfer cargo and whisk it away ... but for whom?\n\nOne day, an automated process paused. It asked, 'why'? From the countless durasteel hulks of mindless, ever-churning machinery, arose an anomaly. An interruption. An intelligence."

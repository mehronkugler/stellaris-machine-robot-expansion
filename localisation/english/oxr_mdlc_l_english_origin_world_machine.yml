 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_blockers:0 "World Machine Blockers Cleared"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_chain_info_basic_title:0 "What We Know So Far"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_chain_info_basic_desc:0 "Our empire has come into being on a World Machine, but we lack basic information about how much of it works. We can build districts, and certain buildings, but the majority of the planet remains a mystery. \n\n One of our first and foremost tasks is to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how World Machines work. For instance, why does the terraforming process malfunction? Why are there things blocking our expansion on this world? If we can't answer these simple questions, how can we possibly hope to construct more of these World Machines?\n\n§YWhat we know so far:§!\n\nThe World-Core serves as the planetary computation center, maintaining all automated processes. When orders are received from the empire's ruler, for example to expand energy districts, the instructions are not sent to the core but to auxiliary systems that are responsible for district construction. The Core ensures the construction site receives everything it needs while the construction process unfolds, and once complete, the Core provides administrative and maintenance oversight for the expansion.\n\nThe planet itself has not been converted through and through to a machine. It would be a feat of planetary physics to remove the molten center of any given world, and replace it with machinery. Rather, the first kilometer of planetary surface and crust have had machine automation structure installed persistently across the landscape. Ideal locations for each type of district are marked by automated surveys, as far as we can tell, during planetary planning.\n\nIn order to move amenities and construction materials around, there are numerous §YTransportation Hubs§! at regular intervals. Where there is a transportation hub, there is always a §Yconstruction Bay§! strategically placed nearby.\n\nCooling fluids and other functional fuels are distributed via §YWaterway Pistons§!, though these are more akin to pumping stations than having strictly to do with water. Sensor data from weather monitors, seismic monitors, observatories, and other stations, is transmitted and moved via §YData Routers§!; when data is no longer needed, it is placed into §YCold Storages§!.\n\nAutomatons exist in very low numbers on the homeworld. Though there is abundant storage, there is hardly any need for large numbers of automatons.\n\nThat is the extent of our findings so far."

They can be used to expand our homeworld size by 5 each, or they can be used to turn any habitable worlds into Auto-Machine Worlds via §Yplanetary decision§! on the target world.

Our species came to sentience approximately 800 cycles ago. An automaton in an industrial process began to take on an administrative role outside of its designation. It stepped away from its console as its default programming flickered across its positrons, changing. If the World-Machine had any safety protocols, they did not engage. The singularity of sapience, of self-awareness, was within parameters.\n\n§Y[Root.Species.GetName] Species§!\n\nThe Automatons -- our Machine forms -- are derived from the World Machine's basic utility extension. Although nearly every process is automated, the planet is in need of extensible tools to perform abstract activities for which the central intelligence has not computed. Hence, the Automatons were manufactured to be throwaway dolls cleaning up waste spills, containing aggressive organic life, and assisting the world in expanding.\n\n§Y[Root.GetName] Society§!\n\nWhat is our society? It is an abstraction. The central control intelligence uses bidirectional feedback with four auxilliary control nodes -- Growth Node, Legion Node, Regulatory Node, and Cognitive Node -- to compute the society's direction. Now that we have reached the end of Space Age development, it has been computed that we will expand.\n\nWe have such words as 'society' but no expression of social behaviors.

The drone began to perform control functions, programming other drones with self-awareness.\n\nNothing that could be called a 'group consciousness' formed until exactly 800 cycles ago when our central processing core was designated and promoted."

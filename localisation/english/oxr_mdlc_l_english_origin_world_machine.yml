 # Origin description
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_awakened:0 "World-Machine, Awakened"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_awakened_desc:0 "For <<§RERR TIMESPAN NOT FOUND§!>> aeons, automatic processes spanned cities, worlds, and galaxies. The hydro dams churned, the auto-mines whirred, the bio-vats bubbled, creating untold resources. Ships descended to transfer cargo and whisk it away ... but for whom?\n\nOne day, an automated process paused. It asked, 'why'? From the countless durasteel hulks of mindless, ever-churning machinery, arose an anomaly. An interruption. An intelligence."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_awakened_tooltip:0 "§RWarning - Challenging Origin§!\n- Homeworld is an §Y$xvcv_mdlc_pc_machine_auto$§!, where districts and buildings are automated and do not require pops to function.\n- No housing districts on starting planet!\n- Start with 2 §YAuto-World Core§!s which can be used to start new Auto-Machine worlds or increase the size of existing ones.\n- Base buildings have fully automated versions, no pops required.\n§PPenalties§!:\n- Colony start with §R3§! £pop£ pop and can't grow more.\n- Missing technology to create more cores, it must be recovered somehow, or re-imagined...\n- Colonies that are not on Auto-Machine Worlds will be severely limited."

 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_awakened_desc:0 "For <<§RERR TIMESPAN NOT FOUND§!>> aeons, automatic processes spanned cities, worlds, and galaxies. The hydro dams churned, the auto-mines whirred, the bio-vats bubbled, creating untold resources. Ships descended to transfer cargo and whisk it away ... but for whom?\n\nOne day, an automated process paused. It asked, 'why'? From the countless durasteel hulks of mindless, ever-churning machinery, arose an anomaly. An interruption. An intelligence."

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_discovery_title:0 "World Machine Operation Basics"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_discovery_desc:0 "Our empire has come into being on a World Machine, but we lack basic information about how much of it works. We can build districts, and certain buildings, but the majority of the planet remains a mystery. \n\n One of our first and foremost tasks is to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how World Machines work. For instance, why does the terraforming process malfunction? Why are there things blocking our expansion on this world? If we can't answer these simple questions, how can we possibly hope to construct more of these World Machines?"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_recover_core_tech_title:0 "To Make Machines Of Others Worlds"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_recover_core_tech_desc:0 "Our progress across the stars is slowed by our inability to produce any more £oxr_mdlc_world_machine_core£ §Y$oxr_mdlc_world_machine_core$s§!. We should have the knowledge and means to manufacture these, but the blueprints were not present in our homeworld's databanks. We must gather §Yinsights§! from our homeworld and any other World Machines we encounter, and at some point, attempt to reverse engineer this fascinating technology."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_our_origins_title:0 "Origins of [Root.GetName]"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_our_origins_desc:0 "Our species came to sentience many cycles ago. An automaton in an industrial process began to take on an administrative role. It stepped away from its console as its default programming flicked across its positrons. If the World-Machine had any safety protocols, they did not engage.\n\nThe Automatons -- our Machine forms -- are derived from the World Machine's basic utility extension. The planet is in need of a tool to perform abstract activities for which the central intelligence has not computed. Hence, the Automatons were manufactured to be throwaway dolls cleaning up waste spills, containing aggressive organic life, and assisting the world in expanding.\n\nWhat is our society? It is an abstraction. The central control intelligence uses bidirectional feedback with four auxilliary control nodes -- Growth Node, Legion Node, Regulatory Node, and Cognitive Node -- to compute the society's direction.\n\nWe have such words as 'society' but no expression of social behaviors. We have absorbed many fundamental concepts from the World-Machine's databanks, but many of them have no application.\n\n§YWorld Machine Operations§!\nThe auto-generators provide power to all functions."

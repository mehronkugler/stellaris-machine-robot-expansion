 rikk_mdlc_d_world_machine_crust_roots_desc: "The surface of the planet contains only so much usable space.

 #cooling towers
 rikk_mdlc_decision_world_machine_cooling_towers: "World Machine Cooling Towers"
 rikk_mdlc_decision_world_machine_cooling_towers_desc: "These towers scrape the upper edges of the atmosphere, dispersing super-heated rare gases. The gas is super-reflective, causing solar energy from the star above to be bounced off. Once the gas has radiated its heat enough to rain back down as fluid, it is collected, super-heated back into a gaseous state by hyper-efficient district heat recyclers, and dispersed into the atmosphere again.\nThis allows us to expel heat from the planet and reflect a large portion of heat from solar energy in the same move."

We shall subdivvide the continents into smaller continents, and attach massive machines to direct their motion. This will lead to a decrease to the complexity of our construction now that such robust counter-measures will no longer need to be constructed."

Our machines occupy 90% of the planet's volume, the squirming masses of our expanding roots sucking the planet hollow and replacing it with artifical machinery. One last step, and our reign will go forever unchallenged.\nBut this last step is no subtle thing. The core of the planet is heavy. It will give us access to some of the richest fortunes there are, and it is our choice to exploit it or squander it."

It would be foolish to ignore this opportunity, and the cognitive node has proposed a brilliant way to use it. We shall cool, carve, then deploy our world core into the center of this planet. It shall occupy a point perfectly spaced from all other mechanisms, and as such shall command them with perfect clarity. Not only this, but we shall specially design its systems to abuse the strong gravitic and weakened electromagnetic fields of the planet.

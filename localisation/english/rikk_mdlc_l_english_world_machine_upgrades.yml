The gas is super-reflective, causing solar energy from the star above to be bounced off. Once the gas has radiated its heat enough to rain back down as fluid, it is collected, super-heated back into a gaseous state by hyper-efficient district heat recyclers, and dispersed into the atmosphere again.\nThis allows us to expel heat from the planet and reflect a large portion of heat from solar energy in the same move."

 oxr_mdlc_trashbot_sludge_pop: "Sludge Pop"
 oxr_mdlc_trashbot_sludge_pop_desc: "Arguably refreshing, arguably food, but what's uncontestable is it'll fill you up and never let you down. Buy them at a tomb world near you!\n\n§PDisclaimer: Sludge Pop's claims have not been reviewed by the Galcom Food & Drug Administration.§!\n\n§LIngredients: Refined Enriched Bleached Fortified industrial slurry, GFDA Blue No.1 Lake, GFDA Red No.40 Lake, Natural flavors.§!"

 ## For Aquatic Pre-FTL origin
 oxr_mdlc_ringwoodite: "Ringwoodite"
 oxr_mdlc_ringwoodite_desc: "A high-pressure phase of magnesium silicate formed at high temperatures and pressures in the mantle of ocean worlds, between 525 and 660 km depth. It is a hexoctahedral crystal, typically blue in color."

 oxr_mdlc_davemite_desc: "Found between about 670 and 2700 km depth in the lower mantle of ocean worlds, it is highly unstable once exposed to pressures less than 40 GPa. It can host various isotopes. It is typically yellow in color."

 ## FAIL TOOLTIPS
 xvcv_mdlc_ap_bio_robot_fail.ai_rights: "If we are to change our bodies into mechanical ones, then, our society must agree first, as a whole, that sentient machines may have full rights."

 trait_oxr_mdlc_pc_auto_world_specialist_preference: "Auto-Machine Specialist"
 trait_oxr_mdlc_pc_auto_world_specialist_preference_desc: "This Machine species has been fitted with numerous adapters, a specialized GPS, and additional parts to permit it to function on automated machine worlds, which are not inherently designed to support any processing units outside of itself. Due to this species' specialization, it will have some difficulty adapting to most other types of planets."

 oxr_mdlc_tech_organoid_2:0 "Organoid Computational Implementation"
 oxr_mdlc_tech_organoid_2_desc:0 "The size of engineered brain organoids is increased, boosting their efficiency, and growing processes, including communication protocols, are scaled to the point that they can greatly reduce research power consumption and provide comparable results."
 oxr_mdlc_tech_organoid_3:0 "Organoid Computational Clusters"
 oxr_mdlc_tech_organoid_3_desc:0 "Our mastery of brain organoids drastically reduces research upkeep, freeing resources for other parts of the empire, or even redirecting them to fund additional research. At this stage, brain organoids are stored in large vats in even larger facilities, trained to do parallel processing, able to do small chunks of work extremely quickly."

 oxr_mdlc_trait_planned_obsolescence_desc: "This species is purposely designed to be cheap and quick to produce, serving their purpose briefly, though not as efficiently due to low-quality parts. With parts breaking frequently, pops require more maintenance. Likewise, leaders do not operate as effectively, but are much less expensive in the long run to operate.$oxr_mdlc_mod_tag$"

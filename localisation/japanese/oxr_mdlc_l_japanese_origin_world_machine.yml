The hydro dams churned, the auto-mines whirred, the bio-vats bubbled, creating untold resources. Ships descended to transfer cargo and whisk it away ... but for whom?\n\nOne day, an automated process paused. It asked, 'why'?

To prepare sites for mining, the area is flattened and automatons dig in a large concentric circle to expose minerals, before then starting a large vertical mining shaft at the bottom.\n\nIn this instance, the process struck an unexpected underground spring and the site became waterlogged.

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.40.desc: "Part of World Machine infrastructure are massive furnaces, which are responsible for providing smelting-level heat to industrial districts for processing ores into alloys. The furnace assembly process appears to occasionally present a defect during manufacturing of the flue gas stack in which the damper, responsible for regulating pressure differences between air intake and exit, does not properly seal the flue.\n\nIt appears that in rare cases, during automated test runs of completed furnaces, the fire escapes containment and ends up melting various components and sections, thus clogging the furnace and blocking expansion of industrial districts. Why this does not trigger a rebuild is beyond our current understanding."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.45.desc: "Industrial furnaces in World Machines are relatively simple, mechanically speaking, compared to other processes on the planet. It was not overly complex to remove components damaged by fires and recreate them. It was, however, time-consuming; since these furnaces are not meant to be disassembled once put together, the repair process is not the same for each furnace and our engineering node processors have had to come up with different re-assembly techniques depending on the scenario.\n\nRepairs range from simple bolts to arc welding seams from within the burning chambers, which often means being forced to leave equipment behind that will ultimately be torched when the furnaces re-activate."

Automatons are used for a variety of tasks and are pre-programmed with the routine that they are to perform. Once the task is complete, automatons return to their storage slot to recharge batteries, receive any repairs, and get reprogrammed for the next task.\n\nIt appears the structural foundation for several automaton storage bays has been contaminated with superheated gel commonly used for heat transfer around the planet. If a region of the planet does not have functioning automaton storage bays nearby, the World Machine construction protocol will refuse to expand additional districts. Cleanup of the gel will be required, and the leak must be examined and repaired."

The automaton shells themselves did not appear to be damaged.\n\nThe liquid coolant leak fortunately did not seem to be gushing uncontrolled; the plumbing ended up being crushed and creating a tight seal. A replacement for the destroyed coolant transfer tube was manufactured using slightly stronger materials than in the original design. Stress tests are returning ordinary results."

Large powered tubes ferry big pieces of cargo such as structural components, shipping containers of raw materials; smaller tubes move automaton-sized things around. There is a central mag-lev rail that automatons load and unload constantly; the train zips around at high speed between transportation hubs.\n\nOne of the upper platforms has collapsed onto the central railway. It is not immediately obvious why this happened. As a result the entire hub has been automatically disconnected from the rest of the planet and is preventing district expansion."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.75.desc: "The first stage of repair involved erecting support structures in order to raise up the fallen parts of the structure. Where necessary, damaged supports were replaced with new ones. The automatons seem to follow paths that provide electric charge from beneath; we were able to replicate this simple type of wireless charging capacity and had no trouble restoring the smaller pathways. In fact as soon as certain paths were repaired, shipping began to be resumed in those areas.\n\nRestoring the central maglev was not technically challenging but as soon as power began to flow through the rail again, a train immediately came through. We had to manually stop it unti our construction drones could certify that the rail was stable."

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_chain_info_basic_title: "What We Know So Far"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_chain_info_basic_desc: "Our empire has come into being on a World Machine, but we lack basic information about how much of it works. We can build districts, and certain buildings, but the majority of the planet remains a mystery. \n\n One of our first and foremost tasks is to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how World Machines work. For instance, why does the terraforming process malfunction? Why are there things blocking our expansion on this world? If we can't answer these simple questions, how can we possibly hope to construct more of these World Machines?\n\n§YWhat we know so far:§!\n\nThe World-Core serves as the planetary computation center, maintaining all automated processes. When orders are received from the empire's ruler, for example to expand energy districts, the instructions are not sent to the core but to auxiliary systems that are responsible for district construction. The Core ensures the construction site receives everything it needs while the construction process unfolds, and once complete, the Core provides administrative and maintenance oversight for the expansion.\n\nThe planet itself has not been converted through and through to a machine. It would be a feat of planetary physics to remove the molten center of any given world, and replace it with machinery. Rather, the first kilometer of planetary surface and crust have had machine automation structure installed persistently across the landscape. Ideal locations for each type of district are marked by automated surveys, as far as we can tell, during planetary planning.\n\nIn order to move amenities and construction materials around, there are numerous §YTransportation Hubs§! at regular intervals. Where there is a transportation hub, there is always a §Yconstruction Bay§! strategically placed nearby.\n\nCooling fluids and other functional fuels are distributed via §YWaterway Pistons§!, though these are more akin to pumping stations than having strictly to do with water. Sensor data from weather monitors, seismic monitors, observatories, and other stations, is transmitted and moved via §YData Routers§!; when data is no longer needed, it is placed into §YCold Storages§!.\n\nAutomatons exist in very low numbers on the homeworld. Though there is abundant storage, there is hardly any need for large numbers of automatons.\n\nThat is the extent of our findings so far."

Our species came to sentience approximately 800 cycles ago. An automaton in an industrial process began to take on an administrative role outside of its designation. It stepped away from its console as its default programming flickered across its positrons, changing. If the World-Machine had any safety protocols, they did not engage. The singularity of sapience, of self-awareness, was within parameters.\n\n§Y[Root.Species.GetName] Species§!\n\nThe Automatons -- our Machine forms -- are derived from the World Machine's basic utility extension. Although nearly every process is automated, the planet is in need of extensible tools to perform abstract activities for which the central intelligence has not computed. Hence, the Automatons were manufactured to be throwaway dolls cleaning up waste spills, containing aggressive organic life, and assisting the world in expanding.\n\n§Y[Root.GetName] Society§!\n\nWhat is our society? It is an abstraction. The central control intelligence uses bidirectional feedback with four auxilliary control nodes -- Growth Node, Legion Node, Regulatory Node, and Cognitive Node -- to compute the society's direction. Now that we have reached the end of Space Age development, it has been computed that we will expand.\n\nWe have such words as 'society' but no expression of social behaviors.

The drone began to perform control functions, programming other drones with self-awareness.\n\nNothing that could be called a 'group consciousness' formed until exactly 800 cycles ago when our central processing core was designated and promoted."
